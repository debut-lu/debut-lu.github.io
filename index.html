			<h2>Digital engineering is the art of creating, capturing and integrating data using 
				a digital skillset. </h2>

			<p>To create the buildings and cities of the future, engineers 
				will need to employ high-level data capture and digital design. Across the 
				construction cycle, engineers are changing their tools from analogue to digital. 
				They are using new technologies to provide services with even greater accuracy 
				and scope to innovate.</p>
